# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Build a Markdown Previewer
This project is part of the process for receiving a freecodecamp.org certification in front-end-development-libraries.

The codepen submitted can be found [here](https://codepen.io/scarruthers/pen/gOQvxMQ), with a few tweaks to the css and js to make it work on that site.
